# Customer Subscription Predictive Modelling

The marketing manager at a major financial institution in Canada want to run a campaign for the new product: bank term deposit. We have access to past campaign results on a similar product and using these data we want to build a predictive model to find customers that is most likely to purchase the new product (i.e. finding which customers we should target in our upcoming campaign).

**Goal:**

Our target is finding whether a customer will subscribe to the term deposit (y/n)
